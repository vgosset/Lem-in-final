# Lem-in-final\

This projet was not totaly finish so it is possible that don't run well.
In this projet wwe have a map like that for exemple :
                                          0---0--------0
                                          |   |       /
                                          |   0      /
                                          |   |-----0
                                          0---0
we send ants to this map and the goal is to send the ants across the map.
0 are boxs where ants can stop and '-', '|' are ways they can go.
there is a start box and a end box and it's allowed to put only 1 ant per box.
of course we have limited in time and we have to do a good algorithm.
